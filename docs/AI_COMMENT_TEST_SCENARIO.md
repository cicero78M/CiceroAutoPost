# AI Comment Generation Check

This page describes how to verify that comment generation via OpenAI works inside the app.

## Steps
1. Launch the app and log in to Instagram as usual.
2. Tap the menu icon and select **Check AI Comment**.
3. In the test screen enter any caption text then tap **Generate Comment**.
4. The app calls the OpenAI API and displays the generated comment or an error message.

If a comment is returned, the integration is working correctly.
